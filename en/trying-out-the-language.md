# Trying out the language

If you’d like to try One, you have a few options.

- In your browser. You can try One right here!
- On your computer. The One CLI project is a downloadable executable to run scripts with access to file io and more. See the One CLI docs.

Once you have somewhere to explore, it’s time to learn the language at [here](en/syntax).

## Trying Online in your browser

We have an online compiler page, using this you can easily write a single-file program, run, see the output and share with your friends.

It's here:
<https://run.onelang.org/>

## Trying on your system

For this case, you first need to install the One compiler. You are able to compile the One compiler in Linux (both x86_64 and i386 architecture) and macOS, the BSD family, and finally Windows OS.

For details of each method of installing and compiling One at your operating system, you can take a look at [Installing](en/installing) article.
