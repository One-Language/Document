# ONE Programming Language

ONE is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a compiled language with a focus on performance and efficiency, while maintaining programmer productivity.

## Features

- **Easy to learn**: ONE is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a compiled language with a focus on performance and efficiency, while maintaining programmer productivity.
- **Fast**: ONE is a compiled language, which means that it is compiled into machine code before it is executed. It has a couple of optimization phases that make your code optimized and fast.
- **Secure**: ONE has a compiler and you can design your programs without worring about leaking your source code. Your programs will be compiled into machine code before they are executed. This makes it more secure than interpreted languages. If you are going to sell your programs, you can compile them into native executables for any operating system in a single file and share the executable file with your customers. In this way, you can prevent your customers from seeing your source code unlike many other programming languages. such as Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.
- **Safe**: ONE is a safe language, which means that it is secure to use. It will force you to write secure code. Maybe you do not write secure code, but it will force you to think about security. We tried to force you to follow the best practices and sensible approach to security.
- **Cross-platform**: ONE is designed to be cross-platform, which means that it can be used on any operating system. It is currently supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS. A few of archtechture are supported, such as i386, arm23, and amd64. We will add more archtechture support in the future, But currently, we are focusing on the improvement of the language.
- **Open source**: ONE is open source, which means that it is free to use and modify. It is licensed under the MIT license. We believe that open source is the future of software development. We are trying to extend the open source community and make it more accessible to everyone.
- **Modern**: ONE is a modern language, which means that it has many features that are not found in other languages. It has a built-in package manager, a built-in testing framework, a built-in web server, and many more full-featured libraries for working.
- **Powerful**: ONE has many powerful features that make it a great language for any project. We designed it to be a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used for any project. But we are aware we cannot make it perfect for all projects. So we focused on making it perfect for console softwares and web development. We provide a new novel Web framework called OneWeb.
- **Flexible**: ONE is a flexible language, which means that it is flexible to run on any operating system and different environment with same functionality. We are gathering feedback from the community and we are trying to make it more flexible.
- **Simple**: ONE is a simple language, which means that it is easy to learn and use. It has a clean syntax and follows discipline. We reduced the number of keywords and operators to a minimum, and we made the syntax as simple as possible. It can prevent multi-concept and misunderstanding.
- **Fast**: ONE is a fast language, which means that it is fast to compile and run. It has a very fast compiler in development, and it is very fast to run. It is also very fast to compile and run.
- **Stable**: ONE is not a stable language yet, but we are trying to make it stable. We are trying to make it stable and reliable as soon as possible.
- **Reliable**: ONE is a reliable language, which means that it is reliable to use. By forcing you to write secure code, it will make your programs more reliable. We are tring to add compiler warnings and errors to make it more reliable. It may make it hard for you to write code at first when it's a new language to you, but it will make your code more reliable and secure. So it's better to look at restrictions as a good thing.
- **Scalable**: ONE is going to be a scalable language, we are going to add more features to support concurrency, and safe multi-thread for making it possible for you to extend the scale of your project. As Anna Patterson said the future of programming is cloud. We know it's not possible for big projects to handle big traffic only by scaling up. it's why we are considering scaling out as a big point.
- **Portable**: ONE is a portable language, which means that it is portable to use. It's easy to use on any operating system. End-users can run ONE programs on any operating system without having to install anything. ONE programs can also be compiled into native executables for any operating system in a single file.
- **Efficient**: ONE is an efficient language, which means that it is efficient to use. Reducing memory usage, processors, and developer efforts. We are aware we have to balance between these but we prefer to increase developer efforts to provide a better response in ONE program. ONE is not a language to develop toy software, all we want is to make it easier for you to work on useful, big projects.

There are also many other features that are not listed here.


## Usability space

You can use ONE to create console applications, web applications, and more. You can also use ONE to create libraries and frameworks.

- Console applications
- Web applications
- Libraries
- And more...

We are trying to make ONE a great language for any project. But we are aware we cannot make it perfect for all projects. So we focused on a few fields that we think ONE is perfect for.

## Installation

It is recommended to install ONE using the official installer. You can download the installer from the [official website](https://onelang.org).

### Building from source

If you want to build ONE from source, you can follow the instructions below.

#### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [GNU GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/)
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)

#### Building

```bash
git clone https://github.com/One-Language/ONE
cd ONE
