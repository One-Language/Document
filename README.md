# ONE Programming Language

ONE is a general-purpose programming language that is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a compiled language with a focus on performance and efficiency, while maintaining programmer productivity.

## Features

- **Easy to learn**: ONE is designed to be easy to learn and use. It is a compiled language with a focus on performance and efficiency, while maintaining programmer productivity.
- **Fast**: ONE is a compiled language, which means that it is compiled into machine code before it is executed. It has a couple of optimization phases that make your code optimized and fast.
- **Secure**: ONE has a compiler and you can design your programs without worring about leaking your source code. Your programs will be compiled into machine code before they are executed. This makes it more secure than interpreted languages. If you are going to sell your programs, you can compile them into native executables for any operating system in a single file and share the executable file with your customers. In this way, you can prevent your customers from seeing your source code unlike many other programming languages. such as Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.
- **Safe**: ONE is a safe language, which means that it is secure to use. It will force you to write secure code. Maybe you do not write secure code, but it will force you to think about security. We tried to force you to follow the best practices and sensible approach to security.
- **Cross-platform**: ONE is designed to be cross-platform, which means that it can be used on any operating system. It is currently supported on Windows, Linux, and macOS. A few of archtechture are supported, such as i386, arm23, and amd64. We will add more archtechture support in the future, But currently, we are focusing on the improvement of the language.
- **Open source**: ONE is open source, which means that it is free to use and modify. It is licensed under the MIT license.
- **Modern**: ONE is a modern language, which means that it has many features that are not found in other languages. It has a built-in package manager, a built-in testing framework, a built-in web server, and many more full-featured libraries for working.
- **Powerful**: ONE has many powerful features that make it a great language for any project. We designed it to be a general-purpose language, which means that it can be used for any project. But we are aware we cannot make it perfect for all projects. So we focused on making it perfect for console softwares and web development. We provide a new novel Web framework called OneWeb.
- **Flexible**: ONE is a flexible language, which means that it can be used for any project. 
- **Simple**: ONE is a simple language, which means that it is easy to learn and use. It has a clean syntax and follows discipline. We reduced the number of keywords and operators to a minimum, and we made the syntax as simple as possible. It can prevent multi-concept and misunderstanding.
- **Fast**: ONE is a fast language, which means that it is fast to compile and run. It has a very fast compiler in development, and it is very fast to run. It is also very fast to compile and run.
- **Stable**: ONE is a stable language, which means that it is stable to use. 
- **Reliable**: ONE is a reliable language, which means that it is reliable to use. 
- **Scalable**: ONE is a scalable language, which means that it is scalable to use. 
- **Portable**: ONE is a portable language, which means that it is portable to use. It's easy to use on any operating system. End-users can run ONE programs on any operating system without having to install anything. ONE programs can also be compiled into native executables for any operating system in a single file.
- **Efficient**: ONE is an efficient language, which means that it is efficient to use. 
- **Flexible**: ONE is a flexible language, which means that it is flexible to use.
